Good data organization is the foundation of any project. Most
people have data in spreadsheets, so it's the place that many
projects start.

We organize data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with the data,
but computers require that data be organized in particular ways. In order
to use tools that make computation more efficient, such as programming
languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that
computers need the data. Since this is where most projects start,
this is where we want to start too!

In this lesson, you will learn:

- Good data entry practices - formatting data tables in spreadsheets
- How to avoid common formatting mistakes
- Importing Googlesheets data into R
- Making use of the typing from Googlesheets in R
- Working with data in R

In this lesson, however, you will *not* learn about data analysis with spreadsheets.
Much of your time working with data will be spent in the initial 'data wrangling'
stage, where you need to organize the data to perform a proper analysis later.
It's not the most fun, but it is necessary. In this lesson you will
learn how to think about data organization and some practices for more
effective data wrangling. With this approach you can better format current data
and plan new data collection so less data wrangling is needed.
